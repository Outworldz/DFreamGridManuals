Manuals for DreamGrid - AGPL licensed

Every form you click  in DreamGrid has a Help button at top that address many of the questions people post here.   There are 73 manuals now.  More will be added over time as some things are just missing and DG changes a lot.   

These manuals are  Open Source Word Documents on github at https://github.com/Outworldz/DreamGridManuals in the original form.

I save these as Web pages in DreamGrid in Outworldz_Dreamgrid\OutworldzFiles\Help, and  my "Jenkins" script copies these to Outworldz.com, adds 3 lines to make the background and menus work, and adds a Translate button for over 150 translations.
